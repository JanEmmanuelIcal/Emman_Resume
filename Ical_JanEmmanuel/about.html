      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I am Jan Emmanuel M. Ical, a passionate and determined student who is currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. Growing up, I have always been curious about how technology works and how it can be used to improve people’s lives. This curiosity has grown into a strong interest in programming, web development, and problem-solving using digital tools. I consider myself a lifelong learner—someone who is not only focused on academic growth but also on developing personal values such as perseverance, responsibility, and adaptability. My journey as a student has taught me the importance of discipline and hard work, but also the value of creativity and teamwork. I aim to use the knowledge and skills I am gaining to contribute to innovative projects that address real-world challenges, particularly in areas such as system development, digital communication, and information management. Beyond academics, I am a person who values connection with others, open-mindedness, and continuous self-improvement. Who I am is not defined only by my current achievements, but also by the goals I set for myself and the dedication I put into reaching them.</p>
